                    standard technical and organizational security measures to transfer, store, and process Customer

                    unauthorized or unlawful access to, use, and processing of Customer Data. Customer agrees that
                    LandarCloud may transfer, store, and process Customer Data in locations other than Customer's
                    country. LandarCloud has certified that it adheres to the U.S.-E.U. and Swiss-U.S. Safe Harbor
                    frameworks and their principles. "<strong>Customer Data</strong>" means Stored Data and Account
                    Data. "<strong>Stored Data</strong>" means the files and structured data submitted to the Services
                    by Customer or End Users. "<strong>Account Data</strong>" means the account and contact information

                    <strong>Modifications to the Services</strong>. LandarCloud may update the Services from time to
                    time. If LandarCloud changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their functionality,
                    LandarCloud will inform Customer via the email address associated with the account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Software</strong>. Some Services allow Customer to download LandarCloud Software which may
                    update automatically. Customer may use the Software only to access the Services. If any component of
                    the Software is offered under an open source license, LandarCloud will make the license available to
                    Customer and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of the terms of this
                    Agreement.

                            or Customer's Services account. Third Party Requests may include valid search warrants,
                            court orders, or subpoenas, or any other request for which there is written consent from End

                        <li>
                            Customer is responsible for responding to Third Party Requests via its own access to
                            information. Customer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third Party
                            Requests and will contact LandarCloud only if it cannot obtain such information despite
                            diligent efforts.

                        <li>
                            LandarCloud will make commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent allowed by law and by
                            the terms of the Third Party Request, to: (A) promptly notify Customer of LandarCloud's
                            receipt of a Third Party Request; (B) comply with Customer's commercially reasonable
                            requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third Party Request; and (C) provide Customer
                            with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third Party Request (if
                            Customer is otherwise unable to obtain the information). If Customer fails to promptly
                            respond to any Third Party Request, then LandarCloud may, but will not be obligated to do
                            so.

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>. If Customer uses any third-party service (e.g., a service that uses a
            LandarCloud API) with the Services, (a) LandarCloud will not be responsible for any act or omission of the
            third party, including the third party's access to or use of Customer Data and (b) LandarCloud does not
            warrant or support any service provided by the third party.

                    (ii) uses the Services in a manner that LandarCloud reasonably believes will cause it liability,
                    then LandarCloud may request that Customer suspend or terminate the applicable End User account. If
                    Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate the End User account, then LandarCloud may do so.

                    <strong>Security Emergencies</strong>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if there is a
                    Security Emergency then LandarCloud may automatically suspend use of the Services. LandarCloud will
                    make commercially reasonable efforts to narrowly tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or

                    reasonably necessary for LandarCloud to offer the Services (e.g., hosting Stored Data). This

                    payment provider used to process payment of fees).

                    or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of the third party.
                    In no event will LandarCloud have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (i)

                    <strong>Informal Resolution</strong>. LandarCloud wants to address your concerns without resorting
                    to a formal legal case. Before filing a claim, each party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by
                    contacting the other party through the notice procedures in section 12(e). If a dispute is not
                    resolved within 30 days of notice, Customer or LandarCloud may bring a formal proceeding.

                    federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California solely for injunctive relief to stop
                    unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights without
                    first engaging in the informal dispute notice process described above. Both Customer and LandarCloud

                    arbitrations are not allowed.
